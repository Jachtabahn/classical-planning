# Classical Planning in Artificial Intelligence

In this talk the [Graphplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphplan) algorithm is presented. The talk also handles the problem of reducing a planning problem to a Satisfiability Checking problem. The latter approach leads to the [Satplan algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satplan).

This talk was held at the RWTH Aachen University in 2015.
